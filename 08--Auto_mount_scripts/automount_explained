# Auto-Mount Explained

The purpose of **auto-mount scripts** is to automatically connect your Windows system to the Raspberry Pi NAS share at every boot or login, so you don’t need to manually map the drive each time.

## How It Works
1. A batch script (`automount-nas.bat`) contains the `net use` command with your NAS details.
2. The script is placed in the Windows **Startup folder**, or set as a scheduled task, so it runs when the computer starts or the user logs in.
3. Windows connects the network drive and assigns it a drive letter (e.g., `Z:`).

## Why Auto-Mount?
- Saves time → no need to re-enter credentials.
- Ensures applications can always find the NAS files at the same drive letter.
- Improves workflow for backups, media libraries, or shared development projects.
