# Persistence Logic

To make sure the NAS drive auto-mounts every time you log in, the `automount-nas.bat` script must be set to run automatically. There are two reliable methods:

## 1. Startup Folder (Simple)
1. Press **Win + R**, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.
2. Copy your `automount-nas.bat` file into this folder.
3. On the next login, Windows will run the script automatically.

✅ Best for single-user PCs.

## 2. Task Scheduler (Robust)
1. Open **Task Scheduler** → *Create Task*.
2. Under **General**:
   - Run whether user is logged in or not.
   - Check **Run with highest privileges**.
3. Under **Triggers**:
   - Add → *At log on*.
4. Under **Actions**:
   - New → *Start a program* → point to `automount-nas.bat`.
5. Save and enter your Windows credentials.

✅ Best for shared/multi-user PCs or servers.

## Why This Matters
- Without persistence, mapped drives may disappear after reboot.  
- Startup folder = quick setup.  
- Task Scheduler = more reliable, especially with admin permissions.
