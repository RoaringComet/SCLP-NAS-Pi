# Testing Samba Server

After completing installation, directory setup, user creation, and `smb.conf` configuration, use the following steps to test your Samba server.

---

## 1. Restart Samba Services
```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd nmbd
sudo systemctl enable smbd nmbd
2. Check Samba Status
bash
Copy code
systemctl status smbd
systemctl status nmbd
✅ Both services should show as active (running).

3. Test Configuration File
bash
Copy code
testparm
✅ Confirms that your /etc/samba/smb.conf file is valid.

4. Local Access Test
bash
Copy code
smbclient -L localhost -U nasuser
Enter your Samba password.

Should display list of shares (e.g., Public, NASUser).

5. Windows Access
Open File Explorer.

In the address bar type:

php-template
Copy code
\\<your Pi IP>
You should see your shared folders.

Double-click and enter Samba username & password if required.

6. Linux Access
bash
Copy code
smbclient //"<your Pi IP>"/Public -U nasuser
or mount:

bash
Copy code
sudo mount -t cifs //<your Pi IP>/NASUser /mnt/test -o username=nasuser
7. Common Issues
Permission denied → Check valid users in smb.conf and file system ownership (ls -l).

Cannot see shares from Windows → Ensure port 445/139 is open (sudo ufw allow samba).

Read-only access → Check read only = no, create mask, and directory mask.
