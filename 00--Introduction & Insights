# 01. Project Overview

## Introduction
This project sets up a Raspberry Pi-based Network Attached Storage (NAS), enabling centralized file storage and sharing across multiple devices on a local network. 
The added goal is to add script based power cutoff and automatic remounting on boot feature to make it more power efficient.
The aim is to create a low-cost, flexible, and customizable NAS solution for personal or small-scale use.

## Objectives
- Build a NAS using a Raspberry Pi and an external storage device.  
- Provide reliable file storage accessible from multiple clients (Windows, Linux, mobile).  
- Ensure secure access control with user authentication.  
- Optimize for simplicity, low power consumption, and scalability.  
- Add a mounting script on the main client (laptop) to optimise connecting procedure
- Add a shutdown script to remotely and safely turn off the Pi when not in use.

## Features
- Centralized storage accessible over SMB/CIFS protocol.  
- User authentication with controlled read/write permissions.  
- Persistent network drive mounting for seamless client access.  
- Lightweight, low-power Raspberry Pi server operation.  
- Remote shutdown using scripts

## Why Raspberry Pi NAS?
- Affordable hardware compared to dedicated NAS systems.  
- Full control over configurations and software.  
- Great learning project covering networking, storage systems, and server setup.  
- Easily expandable with more external hard drives or SSDs.  
- Practical usecase of being a centralised data storage centre in local network
- Good exposure to powershell scripting (for windows)
