# Manual Power Control  

Manual power control ensures safe startup and shutdown when automation is not desirable.  

## Methods of Control  
1. **Desktop Batch Files**  
   - One-click shutdown (`shutdown-nas.bat`).  
   - One-click startup possible with Wake-on-LAN (if supported).  

2. **SSH Commands**  
   - `ssh pi@<ip> sudo shutdown now` for remote shutdown.  
   - Useful when batch files are not configured.  

3. **Physical Switch**  
   - USB power switch or smart plug can cut power manually.  
   - Must only be used after proper shutdown to prevent HDD corruption.  

## Best Practice  
- Always unmount drives before cutting power.  
- Maintain redundancy (backup scripts + physical switch).  

**Outcome:** A hybrid approach (manual + automated) gives flexibility and ensures system safety.
