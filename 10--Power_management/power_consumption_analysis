# Power Consumption Analysis  

Analyzing power draw helps in optimizing NAS performance and planning UPS/battery backup.  

## Observations  
- **Raspberry Pi 4B:** ~3–7W (depends on CPU load and peripherals).  
- **External HDD (3.5” with adapter):** ~6–10W.  
- **Idle vs Load:**  
  - Idle NAS (Pi + HDD) ≈ 6–8W.  
  - File transfers (high load) ≈ 12–15W.  

## Why Analysis Matters  
1. **Cost Efficiency** – Lower electricity bills with optimized configurations.  
2. **Backup Planning** – Determines UPS capacity for uninterrupted access.  
3. **Thermal Safety** – High consumption often correlates with heat spikes.  

**Tip:** Use `vcgencmd measure_volts` and `vcgencmd measure_temp` on Raspberry Pi to correlate voltage, power draw, and temperature.
