# Startup Automation Decision  

A critical design choice is whether the NAS should **auto-start on boot** or require **manual startup**.  

## Auto-Start Pros  
- Immediate availability when power is restored.  
- Hands-off convenience for 24/7 NAS operations.  

## Auto-Start Cons  
- Increased wear on HDDs if power outages are frequent.  
- May restart during unstable power conditions, risking corruption.  

## Manual Start Pros  
- Controlled startup reduces stress on hardware.  
- Admin can check system health before bringing services online.  

## Manual Start Cons  
- Requires user intervention after every reboot.  
- Less convenient for remote-only access.  

**Conclusion:** In most home NAS setups, enabling auto-start is beneficial if paired with a UPS. For sensitive drives, manual start may be preferable.
