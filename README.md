# SCLP-NAS-Pi
This project implements a Network Attached Storage (NAS) using a Raspberry Pi with a Kingston HDD. Storage is shared via a SAMBA server on the local Wi-Fi network, secured by username/password authentication. Automated scripts optimize power consumption and enhance component longevity. The NAS is accessible by local network devices securely.
