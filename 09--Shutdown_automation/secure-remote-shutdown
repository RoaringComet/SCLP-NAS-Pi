Secure Remote Shutdown with Public Key Authentication

We combine SSH key authentication with a simple .bat file to securely power off the Raspberry Pi NAS from Windows.

Why Public Key?

No password prompts during automation.

More secure than storing passwords in scripts.

Convenient for 1-click actions.

Step 1: Ensure passwordless SSH is working

Follow steps in passwordless-ssh.md.

Step 2: Write the shutdown script

Create a file named shutdown-nas.bat on your Windows Desktop:

@echo off
echo Sending shutdown command to Raspberry Pi NAS...
ssh <username>@<pi-ip> "sudo shutdown now"
pause

Step 3: Allow shutdown without sudo password

On Raspberry Pi, edit sudoers file:

sudo visudo


Add the line:

<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown

Step 4: Test it

Double click shutdown-nas.bat on your Desktop.

The Pi will shutdown instantly without asking for a password.

âœ… Result: A beautiful 1-click remote shutdown button for your Raspberry Pi NAS.
