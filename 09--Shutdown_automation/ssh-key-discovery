Discovering and Generating SSH Keys

SSH keys allow secure, passwordless authentication between your Windows machine and the Raspberry Pi NAS.
Before setting up passwordless login, you need to check if an SSH key already exists on your system.

Step 1: Check if an SSH key exists

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.

Run:

dir %userprofile%\.ssh


If you see files like id_rsa and id_rsa.pub, you already have a key pair.

Step 2: Generate a new SSH key (if none exists)

Run:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"


When asked for file location, press Enter to accept default (C:\Users\<YourName>\.ssh\id_rsa).

When asked for passphrase, leave blank (for automation).

Now you have two files:

id_rsa (private key — keep safe)

id_rsa.pub (public key — share with Raspberry Pi)
