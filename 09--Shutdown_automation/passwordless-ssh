Setting Up Passwordless SSH Login

After generating keys, we’ll copy the public key to the Raspberry Pi.

Step 1: Copy public key to Raspberry Pi

Use the following command (replace <pi-ip> and <username> with yours):

ssh-copy-id <username>@<pi-ip>


If ssh-copy-id isn’t available on Windows, manually copy the key:

type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh <username>@<pi-ip> "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

Step 2: Test passwordless login

Try logging in:

ssh <username>@<pi-ip>


If it does not ask for a password, the setup worked.

Step 3: Ensure correct permissions (on Raspberry Pi)

Log into Pi and run:

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Now your Raspberry Pi is ready for automation scripts like remote shutdown without password prompts.
