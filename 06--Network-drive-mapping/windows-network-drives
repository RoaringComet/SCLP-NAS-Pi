Windows Network Drives

This guide explains different ways to access and map a Samba share from a Raspberry Pi (or any NAS) on Windows.

Example UNC path:

\\192.168.0.105\SoumyadeepNASPi


Server_IP → The IP address or hostname of the Raspberry Pi.

Share_Name → The Samba share you created (e.g., SoumyadeepNASPi).

Methods to Access Network Drives
1. Direct Access (Run Menu / Explorer)

Press Win + R → type:

\\<Pi_IP_Address>\<Share_Name>


Hit Enter.

Enter Samba username and password if prompted.

The folder opens in Explorer (temporary access).

2. Map Network Drive (GUI)

Open This PC → click Map network drive (top ribbon).

Choose a drive letter (e.g., Z:).

Enter path:

\\<Pi_IP_Address>\<Share_Name>


Enter Samba credentials → Done.

The share now appears as a permanent drive in Explorer.

3. Command Prompt (net use)

Run in CMD:

net use Z: \\<Pi_IP_Address>\<Share_Name> /user:<smb_username>


Example:

net use Z: \\192.168.0.105\SoumyadeepNASPi /user:soumyadeep


Prompts for password.

Mounts the share as Z:.

4. PowerShell (New-PSDrive)

Run in PowerShell:

New-PSDrive -Name "Z" -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\<Pi_IP_Address>\<Share_Name>" -Credential (Get-Credential) -Persist


Prompts for Samba username & password.

Mounts as Z: (persistent if -Persist is used).

Authentication Notes

Username = Samba user you created on Pi (e.g., soumyadeep).

Password = The Samba password set with smbpasswd.

You can save credentials using Windows Credential Manager (see drive-persistence.md
).

Common Issues

Wrong username/password → Ensure Samba user exists:

sudo smbpasswd -a <username>


Share not found → Verify Pi is online and Samba service is running:

sudo systemctl status smbd


Firewall blocking → Make sure ports 445 and 139 are open on the Pi.
