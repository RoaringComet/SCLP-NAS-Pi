# Z-Drive Mapping

This document explains how the Samba share hosted on the Raspberry Pi was mapped to the **Z:** drive in Windows.

---

## Steps Performed

1. **Locate the Samba Share**
   - Pressed `Win + R` on Windows.
   - Entered:
     ```
     \\<Pi_IP_Address>\SoumyadeepNASPi
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     \\192.168.0.xxx\SoumyadeepNASPi
     ```

2. **Authenticate**
   - A login prompt appeared.
   - Entered the **Samba username** and **password** configured earlier on the Pi.
   - On successful authentication, the NAS share opened in File Explorer.

3. **Map as Network Drive**
   - Opened **File Explorer** → Right-clicked **This PC** → Selected **Map Network Drive...**
   - Chose **Drive letter:** `Z:`
   - Entered the folder path:
     ```
     \\<Pi_IP_Address>\SoumyadeepNASPi
     ```
   - Checked the box **Reconnect at sign-in** (optional but recommended).
   - Clicked **Finish**.

4. **Result**
   - The Samba share now appears as a **Z:** drive in File Explorer.
   - Files can be read and written directly like any local disk.
   - Example screenshot structure:
     ```
     Z:\
     ├── Documents
     ├── Media
     └── Backups
     ```

## Notes
- If authentication fails, ensure the Samba username and password match what was created on the Raspberry Pi.  
- If the drive does not reconnect automatically, see **drive-persistence.md**.
