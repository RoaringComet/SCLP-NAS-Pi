# System Optimization

This file serves as a placeholder for general optimization notes.

## Performance Tweaks
- Adjust GPU memory split if using desktop or graphics-heavy tasks.
- Disable unused interfaces (e.g., SPI, I2C, camera) via `raspi-config`.
- Consider enabling zram for better memory management.

## Reliability Tweaks
- Reduce SD card write cycles:
  - Use `tmpfs` for logs or cache.
  - Disable swap if not required.
- Disable HDMI output if running headless.

## Power Saving
- Optionally turn off onboard LEDs for lower power consumption.
- Tweak Wi-Fi power management settings for efficiency.

## Notes
- Actual optimization strategy will depend on the final project requirements.
- More specific tuning to be added after testing workloads.
