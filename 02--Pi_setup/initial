# Initial Boot Configuration

## Step 1: Physical Setup
- Insert the prepared SD card into the Raspberry Pi.
- Connect the Raspberry Pi to a reliable power source.
- For **headless setup**:
  - No monitor, keyboard, or mouse required.
  - Pi will automatically attempt to connect to the configured Wi-Fi.

## Step 2: Network and SSH Access
- Once powered on, the Raspberry Pi will boot and join the Wi-Fi network set in Raspberry Pi Imager.
- To locate the Pi:
  - Use your router's connected device list to find the hostname (e.g., `pi-main`).
  - Alternatively, use a network scanner like `Advanced IP Scanner` or `nmap`.
- Connect via SSH:
  - Open a terminal (Linux/Mac) or PowerShell (Windows).
  - Run `ssh username@hostname.local`  
    Example: `ssh pi@pi-main.local`
  - Enter the password you configured during flashing.

## Step 3: First Login Checks
- After logging in, verify system details:
  - Run `hostname` to confirm device name.
  - Run `ifconfig` or `ip a` to confirm Wi-Fi connection.
- Update the package list (to be done later in SSH setup section).
