# Headless Access Guide

This guide explains how to access your Raspberry Pi **headlessly** (without connecting a monitor, keyboard, or mouse).

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit Desktop version).
- MicroSD card flashed with Raspberry Pi Imager and pre-configured (hostname, username, Wi-Fi, SSH enabled).
- Your local Wi-Fi network SSID and password configured during flashing.
- Advanced IP Scanner (or similar tool) installed on your PC to find the Pi’s IP address.

## 2. Finding the Raspberry Pi IP Address

1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to power.  
   It will boot and connect to the Wi-Fi network set during configuration.  

2. Open **Advanced IP Scanner** (or another network scanner) on your PC.  

3. Scan your local network and locate the entry corresponding to the Pi.  
   - It will usually show up as `raspberrypi` or with the hostname you set.  
   - Note down the IP address, e.g., `<your Pi IP>`.

## 3. Headless SSH Access

1. On your PC, open a terminal (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows).  

2. Run the following command to connect:

   ```bash
   ssh pi@<your Pi IP>

Replace pi with your Pi’s username (if different).

Replace <your Pi IP> with the actual IP address you found.

Enter the password you set during Raspberry Pi Imager configuration.

If successful, you will see the Raspberry Pi shell prompt:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $

4. Verifying Connectivity

Before SSH, you can verify the Pi is reachable:

ping <your Pi IP>


A successful response means the Pi is online.

5. Post-Login Steps

Once logged in via SSH:

Update packages immediately:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y


Confirm your hostname:

hostname


You are now fully connected to your Raspberry Pi headlessly.
