# Troubleshooting SSH

This section lists common SSH issues faced during Raspberry Pi setup and their solutions.  

---

## 1. Permission Denied (Password)
**Problem:**  
While connecting with:
```bash
ssh pi@<your Pi IP>
it repeatedly asked for password but access was denied.

Cause:

Wrong password typed.

Username not matching (pi vs custom user).

SSH service not running.

Fix:

Confirm correct username and password used during flashing.

Ensure SSH service is active:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status ssh
Re-enable SSH if disabled:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable ssh --now
2. SSH Config File Missing
Problem:
I created userconf or SSH config files earlier but couldn’t find them later.

Cause:

Files not created in the right boot partition.

Files deleted after first boot (Pi consumes them).

Fix:

Recreate the file in the boot partition before first boot:

text
Copy code
ssh   (empty file to enable SSH)
userconf   (for custom username/password if needed)
If already booted, manually enable SSH:

bash
Copy code
sudo raspi-config
→ Interfacing Options → SSH → Enable

3. Connection Refused
Problem:
Tried ssh pi@<your Pi IP> but got:

text
Copy code
ssh: connect to host <your Pi IP> port 22: Connection refused
Cause:

SSH service not installed or disabled.

Firewall blocking port 22.

Fix:

Enable SSH:

bash
Copy code
sudo raspi-config
Check firewall rules:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow 22
4. Wrong IP Address
Problem:
SSH failed because <your Pi IP> was not correct.

Fix:

Find correct IP:

bash
Copy code
hostname -I
Or from router admin page.

Reconnect using the correct one:

bash
Copy code
ssh pi@<your Pi IP>
5. Key Authentication Not Working
Problem:
After setting up keys, SSH still asked for password.

Cause:

Wrong permissions on .ssh folder.

Public key not copied correctly.

Fix:

Set proper permissions:

bash
Copy code
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Re-copy key:

bash
Copy code
ssh-copy-id pi@<your Pi IP>
