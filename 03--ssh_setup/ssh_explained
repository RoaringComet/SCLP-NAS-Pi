# SSH Explained

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol that allows secure remote login and command execution.  
For the Raspberry Pi, it is the main method of accessing the system headlessly.

- **Encryption** → prevents others from reading traffic.  
- **Authentication** → password or SSH keys verify the user.  
- **Port** → default is TCP 22.  

You can use SSH to:
- Manage files
- Install software
- Run scripts
- Monitor system health
