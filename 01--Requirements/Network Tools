# Networking Setup

Your NAS must be reachable reliably on the home/office network. By default, Raspberry Pi gets a dynamic IP via DHCP, but for consistent access you should configure a static IP or DHCP reservation.

---

## 1) Accessing Pi via Network

- Connect Raspberry Pi to router/switch using Ethernet (recommended for speed and stability).  
- Find Pi’s IP address:  
  - Check router’s DHCP client list, or  
  - Run `arp -a` on Windows, or  
  - Use `hostname -I` on the Pi itself.

---

## 2) Setting a Static IP (Method 1: via Router)

- Go to your router’s admin panel.  
- Bind the Pi’s MAC address to a fixed IP (DHCP reservation).  
- Easiest and most reliable method, survives OS reinstall.

---

## 3) Setting a Static IP (Method 2: on Raspberry Pi)

Edit the DHCP client configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf


Add at the end (replace with your network values):

interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.50/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8

Then reboot:

sudo reboot

Ping the Pi from your PC:

ping 192.168.1.50


SSH into the Pi:

ssh pi@192.168.1.50


From Windows, test Samba share access later via:

\\192.168.1.50\ (remember this is a dummy IP !)





# OTHER NETWORK STUFFS THAT ARE OBVIOUS 

## 1) A valid and running local Wi-Fi (the server will be hosted on this)

## 2) SAMBA server (we will use powershell to directly install that on the Pi)

that's it :)
