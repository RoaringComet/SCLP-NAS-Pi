# Software Requirements & Downloads

This NAS uses Raspberry Pi OS + Samba for Windows-friendly file sharing. Below are the tools and packages you need, with short explanations and install commands.

---

## 1) Imaging & Setup Tools (on your PC)

- Raspberry Pi Imager â€“ to flash Raspberry Pi OS to microSD.  
  - Features: set hostname, Wi-Fi/Ethernet, username/password, and enable SSH before first boot.
- SSH client  
  - Windows 10/11: built-in OpenSSH (PowerShell: `ssh pi@<ip>`).  
  - Optional: PuTTY if you prefer a GUI.

## 2) Operating System (for the Pi, on your PC)

- Raspberry Pi OS with desktop (32-bit) is recommended (headless server, minimal overhead).[ https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2025-05-13/2025-05-13-raspios-bookworm-armhf.img.xz ]
- First boot configuration:
  - Set hostname (e.g., `raspberrypi`).
  - Enable SSH.
  - Configure locale/timezone.
  - Ensure Ethernet is plugged to router/switch.
// we will be discussing setup later dont worry :)

## 3) Advanced IP scanner (on your PC)
- you will need to scan your local network after setting up your pi.
- setting up means - inserting SD card post flashing onto the Pi and connecting it to power and WiFi over Ethernet.

---

## 4) Powershell (on your windows PC)
- default scripting language to access and setup the Pi.

## 5) Core Packages (on the Pi, via windows power shell)

After first boot (via SSH), update and install:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y

# File sharing (SMB/CIFS)
sudo apt install -y samba samba-common

# Useful filesystem tools (exFAT support, if you use exFAT disks)
sudo apt install -y exfat-fuse exfatprogs

# Diagnostics & health
sudo apt install -y htop iotop smartmontools hdparm lshw

# Convenience
sudo apt install -y nano vim git curl wget
// we will discuss this setup later as well :)
