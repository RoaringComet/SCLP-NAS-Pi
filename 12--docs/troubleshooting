# Troubleshooting Common NAS Issues

## Connection Issues
- Cannot ping Pi: check network, cable, and static IP.
- Drive mapping fails: verify Samba service, username, and password.

## Permission Issues
- Access denied: confirm Samba user exists (`sudo smbpasswd -a <username>`) and folder permissions.

## Mounting Issues
- Auto-mount scripts fail: check script path, credentials, and SSH key setup.

## Performance
- Slow transfers: ensure USB 3.0 enclosure, avoid shared Wi-Fi, and check CPU load.
